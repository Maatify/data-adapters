  "description": "Introduced an explicit factory layer and a typed infrastructure error boundary while preserving strict DI-first principles and zero runtime magic.",

  "artifacts": {
    "added": [
      "src/Factories/MySQLAdapterFactory.php",
      "src/Factories/RedisAdapterFactory.php",
      "src/Factories/MongoAdapterFactory.php",

  "decisions": [
    "Factories are an optional convenience layer and not part of the adapter contract",
    "Factories may accept callable():Driver for deferred construction",
    "No runtime instanceof validation is performed when static contracts are present",
    "AdapterCreationException defines the infrastructure error boundary",
    "Adapters remain logic-free and exception-transparent"
  ],

    "All factory callable contracts are enforced via PHPStan (@phpstan-param)",
    "PHPStan level max passes with zero errors",
    "No environment access or auto-detection was introduced",
    "This phase does not include DTO-based factories or configuration handling"
